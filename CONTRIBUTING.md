The least information we typically need to help with an issue is the version of blueman you're using. In most cases the BlueZ version makes sense as well. You can use the following template to make sure you're providing the most basic information:

blueman:  
BlueZ:  
Distribution:  
Desktop environment:

It may also be useful to provide the debugging output from the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/wiki/Troubleshooting), sometimes even multiple examples (e.g. a working one and one where the issue comes up). Please use some service like [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) or [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to post your logs and keep the thread clean and readable. Make sure to describe the exact steps you took when producing it.
