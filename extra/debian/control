Description: A Graphical bluetooth manager
 Blueman is designed to provide simple, yet effective means for 
 controlling BlueZ API and simplifying bluetooth tasks such as:
  Connecting to 3G/EDGE/GPRS via dial-up
  Connecting to/Creating bluetooth networks
  Connecting to input devices
  Connecting to audio devices
  Sending/Receiving/Browsing files via OBEX
  Pairing
 .
 Blueman also integrates with Network Manager 0.7, so any Dialup/Network
 connections will be made available (via HAL) to Network Manager.
